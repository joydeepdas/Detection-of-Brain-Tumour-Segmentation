This part forms the  main or essential application of actually classifying human face from computer generated human faces by exploiting rPPG feature of human pulse.
The aim is to detect pulse in video signals from human frame. Here human pulse ranges from
50-80 bpm (bits/min). Thus we expect a shrap peak in this frequency range.
(1) Crop a video of approx 20sec where over all the frames a face is appearing. Higher the
total sampling time of video higher resolution in frequency domain.
(2) From the human face extracted we take ROI from contant regions like around nose and
forehead, we dont take into account eyes or mouth region as they are subjected to
change.
(3) We now we have say (20 sec * 30 frames/sec)= 600 frames of ROI around Nose. Now
from this we extract the required pulse as follows:-
(4) From each ROI take mean of intensity in R,G,B i.e 1D vectors of 600 R’s,G’s and B’s.
(5) We take temporal average from R,G,B such that Rn= average of R’s over a window of
2n+1, where over this window i.e “n” a pulse must be there. (this step is done for
averaging and lowering high frequencies while still preserving high frequencies.)
(6) Similarly for Gn and Bn.
(7) We then calculate X and Y by formuale :
(8) X = 3Rn − 2Gn (2)
(9) Y = 1.5Rn + Gn − 1.5Bn
(10) We band pass X and Y for 50-80 bpm obtaining Xf and Yf.
(11) Alpha = standard deviation(Xf)/standard deviation(Yf).
(12) Now we define a pulse signal ,p = Xf - alpha * Yf;
(13) Take the take the FFT of Pulse signal p , sharp peak near 50-80 is observed for
human face and arbitrary pics for CG face.
